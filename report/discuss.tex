\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discuss}
In this section, we discuss about the general thoughts behind design and
implementation of our framework {\it Pythia}.

Our system abstracts the idea of speculative execution to the more general idea
of {\it pre-work}s. 
Across many domain spaces, speculative execution can entail many different
things such as pre-fetching from hard disk to memory, pre-fetching the results
of a predicted query from a remote web server, and pre-computing the results of
a predicted query on local data. 
This causes unnecessary complication and complexity for the application
developers who are interested in using excess resources to do some work
ahead-of-time. 

Pre-works are a higher-level concept that encompasses not only the aforementioned
speculative execution use-cases but also considers more abstract concepts such
as the `potential reusability' of pre-works and the system's current excess
resources. 
Thus, {\it Pythia} is a framework that trades excess resources for
improved responsiveness and improved user-experience, thereby applying 
speculative execution to many different applications.

% Due to the limited time-constraints of this class, our class project had
% limited scope with regards to the original higher-level idea of `Speculation
% on Steroids'. One limitation of our current work is that the speculation only
% happens with our single implemented application. One of the core-motivations
% behind the project, was to create a generic speculation framework that
% provides significant benefit across many diverse applications. To have more
% evidence of our system providing this `general speculation framework', we
% would like to test our system across multiple applications and then benchmark
% the performance on each application. 

% Another limitation of the project was the difficulty in finding real data sets
% of user’s traces through an application. We spent the first half of the
% semester trying to find public and/or academic datasets from Google, Facebook,
% and Microsoft to no avail. Ultimately, we settled on using the academic Yelp
% data-set as a candidate application for generalized speculation, but because
% we didn’t have exact user-traces through their application, we still
% encountered some issues with this approach. 

% We ended up having to utilize an analogous heuristic composed of the
% restaurant’s ratings and common reviewers shared between restaurants-- instead
% of exact user’s paths through the program. This let us implement an interactive
% system in time for the class, but also limits the conclusions we can derive from
% the system because it is another level of abstraction from the true generalized
% speculation based on user-traces that our original idea proposed.
