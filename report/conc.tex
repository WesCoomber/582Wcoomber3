\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
In conclusion, we proposed a novel framework that leverages traces of users from
previous or crowdsourced execution to accelerate the latency to do "works". It
is important to note that we have identified a mechanism to build steroeid that
is application, dataset agnostic. However,  due to the limitations from time
constrained factors and lack of user traces, all of which we did not expect when
the proposal was ready, we were able to complete a portion of works as we
proposed in the earlier proposal.
Regardless of the implementation, we have showed a promise in improving
performance for user-facing applications by speculatively do "works" a head of
time based on our novel bi-conditional probability tree.
