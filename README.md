You give the program a business_ID and/or business 'name' and then if the business has a star rating greater than or equal to the 'loadThreshold' value, it will loadup/open 5 images from the business.

#Set testBusinessID
#Set testBusinessName
to whatever you want.

The program requires this exact folder structure. SEE THE UPLOADED PICTURE 'http://imgur.com/a/smWSi'

Tested on windows10. May require changes for linux systems.
